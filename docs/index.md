# MQT MiSiM - A Tool for the Simulation of Mixed-Dimensional Quantum Circuits based on Decision Diagrams

MQT MiSiM is an open-source C++17 and Python library for the simulation of mixed-dimensional quantum circuits based on decision diagrams developed as part of the {doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>` by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).

We appreciate any feedback and contributions to the project. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via [GitHub](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-misim) or [quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de](mailto:quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de).
